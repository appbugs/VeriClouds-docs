The CredVerify API is very flexible and powerful. It can be used in various scenarios to help detect, verify and prevent the risk of compromised credentials.

## Credential Monitoring & Notification
The CredVerify API is used in VeriClouds CredMonitor service to help corporate customers monitor compromised passwords for its employees. The corporate customer can conduct the monitoring based on company domain name and/or person IDs of its employees.

## Authentication & Authorization
The CredVerify API has been integrated into the authentication flow of several websites, Windows OS, etc to protect user logins in real time and fully automatic fashion. When a user logs in, the CredVerify API will be invoked to verify whether the username and password were compromised or not. If a compromise is detected, the user will be blocked from login and/or revoked of sensitive permissions. The user will also be guided to reset password and/or enable 2-factor authentication so that the account can be secured. You can play a live demo here.

## Periodic Account Auditing
Companies typically store the account data of their employees and customers in hashed/encrypted format. The on-premise version of CredVerify API supports scanning of such account records to detect compromised accounts. Corporate customers have used the on-premise API to periodically scan their account directories and spot dangerous compromised accounts.

## Account Risk Scoring
The CredVerify API can be integrated into risk scoring systems to help refine the risk scores for customer accounts. Roughly speaking, the risk score of an account will be increased if compromised passwords are found by the API and the score can be further fine tuned based on other contextual data such as leaked source types and source counts.

## Account Takeover Detection
The CredVerify API can be used to detect account takeover attacks. Account takeover attacks typically leverage a database of compromised credentials and are hard to be detected by traditional IDS methods due to lack of visibility into such a database. The CredVerify API provides great visibility into such data in a secure fashion so that it has great potential to help better pinpoint account takeover attempts.
