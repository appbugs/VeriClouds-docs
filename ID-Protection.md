# Enhanced Identity Protection for Identity Management Module

VeriClouds CredVerify enables digital transformation by providing sophisticated account level security and protection against data breaches for your privileged accounts on your cross-platform network. Very few organizations can distinguish the genuine user from the sophisticated attacker because of the weakest link in cyber security, weak and/or stolen passwords. With RED Identity Management, enabling VeriClouds CredVerify allows you to:

* Detect if a user's credentials are weak or stolen and display a warning or prohibit the user from logging in
* Prevent the use of weak, reused or stolen credentials during self-service password reset
* Choose between VeriClouds' SaaS service or premium on-premise hardware appliance for maximum scalability and security

## Privilege Management Meets Actionable Intelligence
VeriClouds CredVerify is fully integrated into the Lieberman RED Identity Management module. VeriClouds enables the transformation of visibility into compromised credentials discovered on the deep and dark web into an intelligence driven security operation that is an evolution for most organizations.

Enabling VeriClouds CredVerify in your environment:

* Provides visibility into user-centric risk of privileged accounts
* Automates the transformation of insight and analysis into real-time policy enforcement and action
* Outsources the legal liabilities of handling stolen sensitive account data from the dark web
* Significantly minimizes the threat from the #1 cause of data breaches, the weak or stolen password

Integrating and uniting privilege management with superior detective controls closes the loop. It unleashes the full power and potential of compromised credential verification “as-a-service.”
