# Enhanced Identity Protection for Identity Management Module

VeriClouds CredVerify enables digital transformation by providing sophisticated account level security and protection against data breaches for your privileged accounts on your cross-platform network. Very few organizations can distinguish the genuine user from the sophisticated attacker because of the weakest link in cyber security, weak and/or stolen passwords. With RED Identity Management, enabling VeriClouds CredVerify allows you to:

* Detect if a user's credentials are weak or stolen and display a warning or prohibit the user from logging in
* Prevent the use of weak, reused or stolen credentials during self-service password reset
* Choose between VeriClouds' SaaS service or premium on-premise hardware appliance for maximum scalability and security
